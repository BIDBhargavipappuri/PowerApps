# PowerApps - Canvas APP

I built a Canvas App using Microsoft Dataverse as the backend. The main purpose of the app is to let users fill in a form and save their information directly into the Dataverse table.

Canvas app- Canvas APP is great option when you need a lot of flexibility in both design and user experience.Canvas apps we start with blank canvas ,it can be low code, but the option is there to add code when you need more complex configurations and calculations. 

In my app, I used  Power Apps features like collections, submit buttons, edit forms, and a gallery to display the data. Together, these pieces allow users to enter new records or update existing ones easily.

You can view my app/way I built the app in this  video link below.
